Your performance in B minor demonstrates a strong grasp of the intended key, achieving 100% global key compliance. This is a fantastic foundation! However, focusing on pitch accuracy will significantly elevate your singing. While you hit some notes perfectly, others, particularly the A2, G♯2, and G2 notes, wavered, with cents deviations sometimes exceeding -30 or +30. Aiming for greater precision within the 0-25 cent range will minimize off-key moments. Remember, consistent intonation is key, so practice targeting those pitches with more focus.
