Your pitch accuracy performance demonstrates a strong command of intonation, with a median deviation of just 9.36 cents, indicating highly accurate targeting of pitch centers for the majority of your performance (72.5%). This foundational tightness is a significant strength. However, there are specific instances (16.25% of the performance) where pitch targets are missed more significantly, pointing to opportunities for refinement in intonation.

Regarding key congruence, while 83.5% of your notes strictly fit the chosen key, an impressive 94.6% are contextually harmonious. This suggests thoughtful melodic choices that enhance musicality, even if occasionally venturing outside strict diatonicism through stylistic inflections or chromaticism. A key area for development lies in vibrato control, with only 7 out of 90 attempts registering as 'good' (7.7%). This indicates a need for greater consistency and stability in achieving a controlled, musical vibrato. Your portamento transitions, on the other hand, show more consistent control, with over half (55.6%) executed effectively. Developing more consistent control over these specific vocal elements will further elevate your overall performance.

Here are three practical suggestions:
1.  **Targeted Pitch Drills:** Focus on ear training exercises that specifically address intervals and challenging melodic phrases where your pitch deviation tends to be highest, aiming to reduce that 16.25% low accuracy ratio.
2.  **Vibrato Control Exercises:** Incorporate sustained note exercises with a focus on consistent breath support and relaxed throat posture to develop a more controlled and even vibrato from its initiation to its conclusion.
3.  **Slow-Motion Transitions:** Practice glissandos and portamentos in slow motion, paying close attention to the exact start and end points of each slide to ensure precise intonation during melodic movement.
